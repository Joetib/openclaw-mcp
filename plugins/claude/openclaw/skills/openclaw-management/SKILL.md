description: This skill should be used when the user wants to interact with OpenClaw, delegate tasks to their AI assistant, or check gateway status. Activates for AI assistant delegation and orchestration.
---

When the user wants to interact with OpenClaw or delegate tasks, use the OpenClaw MCP tools.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user:

- Wants to chat with OpenClaw ("Ask Claw to...", "Tell my assistant...")
- Delegates tasks ("Have OpenClaw research...", "Let Claw handle...")
- Checks status ("Is OpenClaw running?")
- Manages tasks ("Check task progress", "Cancel that task")

## Tools Reference

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Chat (sync) | `openclaw_chat` |
| Chat (async) | `openclaw_chat_async` |
| Task status | `openclaw_task_status` |
| List tasks | `openclaw_task_list` |
| Cancel task | `openclaw_task_cancel` |
| Gateway health | `openclaw_status` |

## Sync vs Async

**Use sync (`openclaw_chat`):**
- Quick questions
- Simple commands
- When you need immediate response

**Use async (`openclaw_chat_async`):**
- Research tasks
- Long-running operations
- Tasks that might timeout

## Example Workflows

**Quick question:**
```
openclaw_chat message="What's the weather?"
```

**Long task:**
```
openclaw_chat_async message="Research competitors and write a report"
→ { task_id: "task_abc123" }

openclaw_task_status task_id="task_abc123"
→ { status: "running" }

# ... poll until complete ...

openclaw_task_status task_id="task_abc123"
→ { status: "completed", result: "..." }
```
